            In my 1st year research, I was mainly working on health-care application.
            In specific studied on indoor activity recognition using smartphone and iBeacon.
            The key idea is to predict users activity using the location information.
            For example, when user is in the gym, the machine predict that user is training.
            We implement, life-log application using this idea to automatically label the activities.
            <br><br>
            In my 2nd year research, I move to Kaiserslautern, Germany for the internship abroad.
            I stayed in Germany for six month at this time, supervised by
            <a href="https://shoya.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jun.-Prof. Shoya Ishimaru</a>, a

            I was involved in the project HyperMind.
            The idea is to implement a WYSIWYG GUI for the dynamic digital textbook creation.
            My work has being published in UbiComp 2018 as the title "<a

            I wrote my master thesis on the topic I published in the UbiComp.

          <p>
            Graduated in Tokyo University of Science and Technology (TUAT).<br>
            Joined laboratory in Venture Gentiane Laboratory.
            <br><br>
            The laboratory I joined was mainly working on Human Robot Interaction (HRI) and Human Activity Recognition
            (HAR).
            I did my bachelor thesis on "Activity Recognition Using Load Sensor".
            <br><br>
            In Japan, declining of birthrate and aging population is significant social issue.
            The idea is to understand about elderly people's activity while seating together with the heart-rate.
            The seat sensor was provided by the Nagoya University, Japan and this study is a joint-work.
            QCR (Quartz Crystal Resonator) load sensor is a sensor available to collect micro-level frequency including
            heart-rate.
            We made an application of recognizing training activity and the heart-rate synchronously.
            However, now a days, smart-watch role better and easier for collecting heat-rate.
